This is my perpetual effort aimed at summarizing various concepts in cryptography.

You can start with some basic things:
 - [Pairings](pairings): elliptic curve magic behind a lot of interesting crypto
 - [KZG polynomial commitments](/kzg)
 - [RSA accumulators](/rsa-accumulators), or: _"Who needs Merkle trees anyway?"_

Or, you can learn about the most popular digital signature schemes:
 - [Threshold BLS](/threshold-bls) faster than most people know how to do it
 - [Schnorr](/schnorr-signatures)
 - [ECDSA](/ecdsa), and why you should avoid it

Or, some esoteric ones:
 - [BBS+ signatures](/bbs-plus-signatures)

Or, you can read some of my favorite things:
 - [Authenticated Multipoint evaluation Trees (AMT)s](/amt#authenticated-multipoint-evaluation-trees-amts): homomorphic Merkle trees from KZG
 - [Feist-Khovratovich (FK)](/feist-khovratovich), or: _"Why you may not need [AMTs](/amt) after all."_
 - [Groth16](/groth16)
