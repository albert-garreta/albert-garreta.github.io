This is my perpetual effort aimed at summarizing various concepts in cryptography.

You can start with some basic things:
 - [Pairings](pairings), or: _"Versatile elliptic curves that power most modern crypto!"_
 - [KZG polynomial commitments](/kzg), or: _"How to get succinctness if modern SNARKs?"_
 - [RSA accumulators](/rsa-accumulators), or: _"Who needs Merkle trees anyway?"_

Or, you can learn about the most popular digital signature schemes:
 - [Threshold BLS](/threshold-bls), faster than most people know how to do it.
 - [ECDSA](/ecdsa), or: _"What most cryptocurrencies use for signing TXNs"_
 - [Schnorr](/schnorr-signatures), and [why you should prefer it over ECDSA](/schnorr-vs-ecdsa).

Or, some esoteric ones:
 - [BBS+ signatures](/bbs-plus-signatures), or: _"Did you know you can sign Pedersen commitments?"_

Or, you can read some of my favorite things:
 - [Authenticated Multipoint evaluation Trees (AMT)s](/amt#authenticated-multipoint-evaluation-trees-amts), or _"Homomorphic Merkle trees from KZG"_
 - [Feist-Khovratovich (FK)](/feist-khovratovich), or: _"Why you may not need [AMTs](/amt) after all."_
 - [Groth16](/groth16), or: _"Fastest-to-verify, most-succinct zkSNARK scheme"_
