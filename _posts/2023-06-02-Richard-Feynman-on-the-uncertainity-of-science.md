**tl;dr:** _"If you thought before that science is certain, well, that's just an error on your part."_ -- [Richard Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)

I once ran into a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRxx8pen6JY) where Neil deGrasse Tyson 
said the following (in relation to a debate where some of the debaters didn't "believe"[^believe] in global warming nor in evolution):

_"The good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it"_ -- **Neil deGrasse Tyson**

You can see the short video below:

## Uhm, nope. No. Wrong. Sorry, Neil. I like you, but no.

The way to think about, or popularize[^neil], science is not as being "true" or "false."

Science is a **process** that we engage in to discover truths. 
And it often leads us astray[^galileo]$^,$[^aether], which is why this idea of "science being true" can be so misleading.

Science is not a **belief** in any sense of the word. 
While many religions might be based on belief, science is an entirely different beast.
It requires not belief, but experimentation, theory postulation and theory falsification (or refinement).

For example:
 
 - **Experimentation**:
     - Drop apples of different sizes several times from the same height
     - Measure the time they take to fall down
     - Compute each apple's acceleration 
     - Observe that all apples, no matter their size, have the same acceleration $g\approx 9.8\ m/s^2$
 - **Theory postulation**:
     - Propose a theory that says, _"When dropped on Earth, all objects accelerate with $9.8\ m/s^2$"_.
 - **Falsification**:
     - Notice that, for some objects like a light feather, they drop with a smaller acceleration.
     - Therefore, your proposed theory above is actually false, since it does not hold for feathers.
     - Refine it as: _"When dropped on Earth, but in a vacuum, all objects accelerate with $9.8\ m/s^2$"_[^feathers]. 

## A digression on non-falsifiable (and thus non-scientific) theories

The discussion above is **not** to say that unfalsifiable theories[^falsifiable] are junk and are to be dispensed with. 

If your friend tells you, _"there exist pink cars with yellow stripes"_ that is an unfalsifiable theory. 
But is it completely useless? 

Well, it would be very difficult to convince your friend such cars don't exist, so maybe it is?
To change their mind, your friend would have to be shown that all cars in the universe don't match this description, which would take (likely) infinite time. 

Yet the theory can be shown to be true by a trivial observation of such a car.
And indeed, I know a person with such a car (so I know the theory is true)![^idonot]

Interestingly, **religious theories** (e.g., "there is a God") fall into the same category of unfalsifiable but potentially-true theories.
And people who claim to have had direct experiences of the divine are firmly-convinced of their veracity.
I no longer believe these theories should be thrown away (i.e., I recognize the limitations of my own form of consciousness). 
Instead, I think that the alleged consequences of such theories should be acted upon carefully since, if they are false, there is no way to find out due to their unfalsifiable nature. (In layman terms, don't burn or kill people because they don't believe in the same things you do.)

Here's a more palatable unfalsifiable theory, though harder to formalize.
My wise mother once proposed this theory to me when I was being a smartass about how bad unfalsifiable theories can be.
She said _"Okay, how about the theory that **love exists in the world**. Are you gonna throw that theory away too because it's unfalsifiable?"_.
(If you don't know this theory to be true, then you have other problems and I wish I could give you a warm hug.)

## Thinking of "science" as "true" is wrong

Why science is not simply just "true" is best explained by Richard Feynman, a physicist who some of you might know from his work on [quantum electrodynamics (QED)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics)[^nobel].

{: .info}
Or, if you are like me, you know him more from his hilarious autobiographical books such as _"[Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman! (Adventures of a Curious Character)](https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041)"_.

In one of his famous physics lecture, Feynman simply and beautifully explains the **leap of faith** scientist must make when going from a **concrete** scientific experiment to a **general** law that predicts beyond what the experiment tested for.

I include an excerpt below, but I find the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRxFf3p8Ia8) to be much more convincing (and entertaining) to watch: 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tRxFf3p8Ia8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

So, Feynman asks:

{: .success}
_Why are we able to extend our laws to regions that we're not sure?
\
How is it possible?
\
Why are we so confident??_

He then explains that extending such general laws is **the thing we must do** if we are to learn anything new beyond the outcome of the concrete experiment.
The **price we pay**, of course, is we (scientists) stand to be proven wrong in the future:

{: .success}
_It's not a **mistake** to say that [the law] is true in a region where you haven't looked yet.
\
If you will not say that it's true in a region that you haven't looked yet, [then] you don't know anything!
\
[In other words,] If the only laws that you find are those which you just finished observing, then... you can't make any predictions!
[But] the only utility of the science is to go on and to try and make guesses._
\
[...]
\
_So what we do is **always** to stick our neck out!
\
And that of course means that the science is uncertain!_
\
[...]
\
_We **always** must make statements about the regions that we haven't seen or there's no use in the whole business._
\
[...]
\
_We do not know all the conditions that we need for an experiment!_
\
[...]
\
_So in order to have any utility at all to the science...
In order not simply to describe an experiment that's just been done, we have to propose laws beyond their range.
And there's nothing wrong with that, that's the success, that's the point!
\
And, uhh, that makes the science uncertain.
If you thought before that science is certain, well, that's just an error on your part._

Again, Feynman explains the necessity of generalizing "laws" (of physics) from observations made in an experiment.
He stresses that, without generalizing such laws, one could never predict anything beyond what was observed in the experiment.
He also reminds us the price we pay for this: the possibility that one might incorrectly generalize. 
Therefore, science is, by its nature, "uncertain." 
In other words, its laws or (falsifiable) theories are subject to refinement.

## If science isn't "true", then what is it?
 
Please don't be fooled into thinking "science is true" (whatever that's supposed to mean).
Such claims are nonsensical: science is a process and its theories are (mostly) **falsifiable**, which is a fancy way of saying there is room to prove them wrong.
As explained before, this stands in contrast to **non-falsifiable** theories such as _"there exists a bird fully-colored with `#c23ea7`"_ or _"there exists a God"_.

Instead, do any one of two things.

The **first option** is to take a scientific theory and try to falsify it. 
For example, Einstein picked Newton's laws of motion, showed they cannot properly describe motion for objects moving close to the speed of light and generalized them. 
And that's how we got the general theory of relativity and, apparently, GPS on our phones.

{: .info}
**Note:** I look at this as falsifying Netwon's theories, which were simply not going to work accurately in Einstein's extreme conditions, while others might look at it as refining them (since Newton's laws of motion still approximate things very well).

The **second option** is to devise an experiment, make some observations, generalize them into a theory, and see if your theory holds water by checking if it can predict anything useful. 
Then, you can go back to the first option and try to falsify your theory.

{: .success}
In other words, engage in science as opposed to _"believing in science."_

If you must _"believe in <strike>science</strike> [the scientific process]"_, realize you are simply **deferring to the authority** of other scientists and the soundness of the scientific peer review process.
Yet other scientists are people like you and me. 
And we make mistakes, are inherently ignorant or have perverse incentives[^books].


## Conclusion

Science is "not true". 
It is a process that you and me could engage in.
It is not an axiom that you take for granted. 
It is not an authority that you defer to.

If you don't have time to engage in science, you can trust-but-verify.
However, there is a risk you'll be deceived by:
 
 - "scientific" "experts"
 - "scientific" evidence
 - "scientific" truth
 - claims that "science" shows [that X causes Y]
 - claims that "studies show"

Claims like these should be critically inspected.

{: .success}
Ideally, try and mentally-remove the word "science" (and its derivatives) from sentences.
See if they still sounds as convincing.
If not, something is being left out and you could investigate.
 
I do admire deGrasse Tyson's efforts to bring the scientific process to the masses.
And I hope he means well in (mis)stating that "science is true".

Nonetheless, his conflation of "truth" with "science" and the implication that one should "believe" science worries me.
I find it borderline-dangerous in our increasingly-polarized society.
Less "beliefs" that separate us would be good.

Remember that Galileo Galilei was put into house arrest by the Roman Catholic Church for falsifying the theory that the Earth is in the center of the solar system[^galileo].
Less of that would be good too.
And knowing what the **scientific process** is could help: it is **one of our best tools to correct our mistakes and our ignorance.**

[^aether]: Another falsified theory was the _"Aether Theory."_ Aether was believed to be a medium that filled space and enabled the propagation of light. The famous Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 failed to detect aether, leading to the eventual acceptance of Einstein's theory of relativity, which does not require the existence of aether.


[^believe]: I write "believe" in quotes because I find the usage of the term "believe" to be over-simplifying when it comes to how one should engage with complex scientific theories like the theory of anthropogenic climate change. In other words, to simply have to pick between _"Do you or do you not believe in global warming?"_ is a disastrous way of getting any clarity on the causes of global warming. A better way might be to ask someone _"What evidence is there for anthropogenic climate change and have you taken a close look at it?"_. (PS: This blog post is not about the climate change issue.)

[^books]: Several books can be (and probably have been) written on the perverse incentives in academia, in scientific peer-review, science funding, etc.

[^falsifiable]: The most widespread philosophy of science comes from Karl Popper, who argued that a theory or statement is scientific only if it can, in principle, be empirically falsified or disproven. In other words, if there's no way to test a theory such that it could potentially be shown to be false, then it's not a scientific theory. But not all philosophers of science agree with Popper. For example, some argue that scientific theories must not only be falsifiable but also empirically confirmed to some degree. Others argue that certain scientific theories are unfalsifiable in practice but remain scientific because they are part of broader theoretical framework that are testable as a whole and/or because they might be falsifiable with better technology (e.g., string theory). In this last case, indirect evidence, logical coherence, and the theory's ability to explain and predict phenomena play a crucial role is what gets the theory to be viewed as scientific.

[^feathers]: This principle of air resistance was famously demonstrated, albeit on the Moon, by astronaut David Scott during the Apollo 15 mission.He dropped a feather and a hammer side by side on the Moon. Due to the absence of air resistance on the Moon, they hit the lunar surface at the same time, providing a visual demonstration of this principle.

[^galileo]: For example, in some less enlightened parts of the word, the "scientific" belief used to be that Earth was in the centre of our solar system and that the Sun and stars revolved around it. Galileo Galilei was put into house arrest for the "heresy" of giving evidence that this theory may be wrong.

[^idonot]: I do not. Just trying to make a point.

[^neil]: I do want to recognize Neil deGrasse Tyson's amazing efforts in popularizing science by speaking about it in a particularly entertaining way. In a way, that's likely the problem behind his "science is true" claim: he did not carefully balance between entertainment and actual education.

[^nobel]: Feynman, Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965 for their contributions to QED.
