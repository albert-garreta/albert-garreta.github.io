**tl;dr:** ECDSA is one of the most widely-deployed signature schemes (for better or worse).
ECDSA is _efficient_, offers _versatility_ via its [pubkey recovery](#pubkey-recovery) feature and is widely adopted due to Bitcoin's success.
Its history is fascinating, as is its security analysis.
Nonetheless: you should **stay away from it**, as I argue [here](#why-you-should-avoid-ecdsa).

## Preliminaries

 - Let $\lambda$ denote a security parameter (typically, set to 128)
 - Let $\Gr$ denote a group of prime order $p$, where $p \approx 2^{2\lambda}$, such that the discrete logarithm assumption is hard in $\Gr$
    - For ECDSA, $\Gr$ is an elliptic curve group[^Cost12]
    - In this case, we let $\Fq$ denote the base field of the elliptic curve group $\Gr$
 - Let $g$ denote the generator of $\Gr$
 - Let $\Zp$ denote the finite field of order $p$ that arises "in the exponent" of $g$
 - Let $\Zps=\\{1,2,3,\ldots,p-1\\}$ denote the multiplicative group of integers mod $p$
 - Let $\bar{x}$ denote the integer representation of $x\in\F$ for any finite field $\F$ (e.g., $\Zp$ or $\Fq$)
 - We assume a collision-resistant hash function $H : \\{0,1\\}^\* \rightarrow \Zp$
    + As per Brown's formalization of _AbstractDSA_[^Brow02].

## History

In 1985, nine years after Diffie-Hellman[^DH76], Taher ElGamal introduced a digital signature scheme and postulated it to be secure under the hardness of discrete logarithms[^Elga85].
Referred to as **ElGamal signatures**, this scheme leveraged the multiplicative group $\Zps$, where $p$ is a prime and $g$ is a [generator](/2021/04/15/basic-number-theory.html#finding-primitive-roots-mod-p).
ElGamal's intuition was that a signature $(r,s)$ for a message $m$ should satisfy:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:elgamal-intuition}
g^m &= \pk^r r^s \bmod p,\ \text{where}\ 0 \le r, s < p-1
\end{align}
<!--And, specifically, that if $r\gets g^k$ for a random $k$, then:
\begin{align}
\end{align}-->
So, ElGamal proposes to sign by "solving"[^elgamal-signing] for $r$ and $s$ as follows:
\begin{align}
k &\randget [0,p-1],\ \text{s.t.}\ \gcd(k, p-1) = 1\\\\\
r &\gets g^k \bmod p\\\\\
\label{eq:elgamal-sig-s}
s &\gets k^{-1}(m - \sk\cdot r) \bmod (p-1)
\end{align}

In 1991, NIST proposed a slight alternation of ElGamal signatures called **DSA signatures** for standardization as part of the _Digital Signatures Standard (DSS)_[^dss].
Unlike ElGamal, DSA assumed a prime $p = hq+1$ where $q$ is a also prime and $h$ is some other number (sometimes called a co-factor).
The signature now became:
\begin{align}
k &\randget [1,q)\\\\\
r &\gets (g^k \bmod p) \bmod q\\\\\
s &\gets k^{-1}(m + \sk\cdot r) \bmod q
\end{align}
DSA was more efficient, since it worked (mostly) over smaller primes $q$, when $p$ was picked appropriately.
It also allowed the signature $(r,s)\in[1,q)$ to be much smaller.

{: .note}
Not sure what the rationale was for changing ElGamal's $k^{-1}(m\textcolor{green}{-}\sk\cdot r)$ into DSA's $k^{-1}(m\red{+}\sk\cdot r)$.

In 1992, Scott Vanstone[^vanstone] proposed **ECDSA** in response to NIST's request for comments on their DSS proposal[^JMV01].
ECDSA is an elliptic curve variant of the DSA scheme, which [this blog post focuses on](#the-ecdsa-signature-scheme).

In 1993, a FOIA request[^foia] revealed that the DSA algorithm was designed not by NIST but by the NSA.

NIST DSA's proposal was not without controversy.
Leading academics like Ron Rivest and Martin Hellman responded to NIST's proposal[^nist-response], pointing to issues such as the use of shared moduli's $p$, small key sizes, the NSA's involvment, the lack of a key-exchange mechanism, DSA's novelty, potential conflicts with Schnorr's patent of his scheme[^Schn89], and the secrecy of the proposal process.

{: .info}
**Some speculation:** Some folks find the NSA's involvement in the DSA standard (and elliptic curve standards) suspicious. 
Perhaps for good reason, given the 2013 EC_DRBG fiasco[^ec-drbg]. 
Others find it reaffirms the security of these schemes[^certicom-ecc].

In 1998 and subsequently, ANSI, IEEE and NIST all standardized ECDSA.

In 1995, David Nccache et al. propose a [batch verification](#batch-verification) algorithm for verifying multiple DSA signatures faster[^NMVR95].
In 2007, Cheon and Yi introduce a batch verification algorithm for ECDSA[^CY07].

In 2002, Daniel L. Brown suggests that ECDSA supports [pubkey recovery](#pubkey-recovery) as an afterthought in an academic footnote[^Brow02]$^,$[^fgrieu-pubkey-recovery].
Later on, the full algorithm is incorporated into a write-up by Certicom Research[^sec-1].

On January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto makes Bitcoin available to the public.
Bitcoin uses ECDSA over secp256k1 curves as its scheme for signing transactions.
Some believe Satoshi chose ECDSA because [Schnorr signatures](/schnorr-signatures) were, at the time, still patented.

{: .info} 
**Some more speculation**: My two cents are that this choice cemented ECDSA's reign in the cryptocurrency space.
Ethereum soon followed in Bitcoin's footsteps.
And all other blockchains followed in Ethereum's.

## The ECDSA signature scheme

In this section, we explain how key generation, signing and signature verification work in ECDSA.
To help the reader understand how ECDSA works, we show why ECDSA is _correct_ (i.e., honestly-computed signature pass verification).
We do not show why ECDSA is _secure_, since the security proofs can be a bit nuanced.
Lastly, we detail ECDSA's [pubkey recovery](#pubkey-recovery) feature, which is often used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

{: .info}
It is **important** to understand that ECDSA only works with **eliptic curve** groups $\Gr$[^Cost12].
Such curves are "built" over a **base field** $\Fq$ such that each group element, or **point**, $P\in\Gr$ is represented by its $x$ and $y$ coordinates: i.e., $P=(x,y)\in\Fq^2$.

### The ECDSA "conversion function"

Another important detail about ECDSA is that it assumes a **conversion function** $f : \Gr \rightarrow \Zp$ that maps a group element into a non-zero field element, which works as follows:

$f(R) \rightarrow r\in \Zp$:
 1. Let $(x,y)\in\Fq^2$ denote the elliptic curve coordinates of point $R \in \Gr$
 1. $r\gets \bar{x} \bmod p$ (recall that $\bar{x}$ is the integer representation of $x\in \Fq$)

### Algorithms

ECDSA key generation, signing and signature verification work as follows:

$\mathsf{ECDSA}$.$\mathsf{KeyGen}(1^\lambda) \rightarrow (\sk, \pk)\in\Gr^2$:
 - $\sk \randget \Zp\setminus\\{0\\}\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// 0 is excluded as a valid SK}}$
 - $\pk \gets g^\sk$

$\mathsf{ECDSA}$.$\mathsf{Sign}(m, \sk) \rightarrow \sigma\in(0,p)^2$:
 1. $k \randget \Zp\setminus\\{0\\}\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// 0 is excluded as a valid nonce}}$
 1. $R\gets g^k$ 
 1. $r\gets f(R)$ (see the [conversion function](#the-ecdsa-conversion-function) above)
     - **if** $r\equals 0$, go back to **step 1**
 1. $s \gets k^{-1}(H(m) + \sk\cdot r) \bmod p$ 
     - **if** $s\equals 0$, go back to **step 1**
 1. $\sigma\gets (r,s)$

{: .info}
**Security:** It is _crucial_ that there be absolutely no bias when picking $k$.
It must pe picked uniformly at random in $\Zp\setminus\\{0\\}$.
Otherwise, an attacker who sees enough ECDSA signatures can ultimately recover the SK[^BH19e].
The easiest way to ensure this is to use a **deterministic** variant of ECDSA[^deterministic-ecdsa].

{: .info}
Signatures are [malleable](#signature-malleability).

$\textcolor{grey}{\text{// assumes}\ \pk\in \Gr}\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{of prime order}}$\
$\mathsf{ECDSA}$.$\mathsf{Verify}(m, \pk, \sigma) \rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$:
 - $(r,s)\gets \sigma$
 - **assert** $r \in (0,p)$
 - **assert** $s \in (0,p)$
 - **assert** $r \equals f\left(\left(g^{H(m)} \pk^r\right)^{s^{-1}}\right)$

{: .note}
In practice, computing this as a size-2 multiexp $g^{s^{-1}H(m)}\pk^{s^{-1} r}$ will be faster!

#### Saving a field inversion during verification

Verification computes a field inversion $s^{-1} \bmod p$, which can be expensive.
However, observe that if we changed signing to output $s\gets k(H(m)+\sk\cdot r)^{-1}$, then verification would just be $r\equals f((g^{H(m)} \pk^r)^s)$.

This remains secure[^i-confirmed], gives slightly faster verification, but precludes precomputing many $(k,k^{-1},R)$ tuples so as to make signing faster. 
Instead, a field inversion $(H(m)+\sk\cdot r)^{-1}$ must be computed during signing. 
And, since this inversion now depends on the message $m$, precomputation is no longer possible. 

Nonetheless, this is a great trade-off in applications where fast verification time is crucial, such as blockchain TXN signature verification.
(Unfortunately, this modification is no longer standard ECDSA, so it will never see wide adoption...)

{: .note}
Interestingly, avoiding this modular inversion during signing could have obviated a recent side-channel attack on ECDSA signing[^eea-side-channel]\: _"This vulnerability lies in the ECDSA ephemeral key (or nonce) modular inversion. [...] More precisely, in the Infineon implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA for short). To our knowledge, this is the first time an implementation of the EEA is shown to be vulnerable to side-channel analysis."_

### Correctness

We show that correctly-computed signatures verify by expanding the verification equation:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ecdsa-verify}
r &\equals f\left(\left(g^{H(m)} \pk^r\right)^{s^{-1}}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &\equals f\left(\left(g^{H(m)} g^{\sk \cdot r}\right)^{s^{-1}}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &\equals f\left(\left(g^{H(m) + \sk \cdot r}\right)^{s^{-1}}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
\label{eq:ecdsa-verify-2}
r &\equals f\left(g^{s^{-1}(H(m) + \sk \cdot r)}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &\equals f\left(g^{\left(k^{-1}(H(m) + \sk\cdot r)\right)^{-1}(H(m) + \sk \cdot r)}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &\equals f\left(g^{k(H(m) + \sk\cdot r)^{-1}(H(m) + \sk \cdot r)}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &\equals f\left(g^k\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &= f\left(R\right)
\end{align}

## Pubkey recovery

ECDSA, together with some variants of [Schnorr](/schnorr-signatures), are one of the few schemes that support a **pubkey recovery** algorithm: i.e., an algorithm that, given a signature $\sigma$ on a message $m$, returns (a set of) public key(s) under which $\sigma$ verifies on $m$.

Pubkey recovery is actually used in cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin, where the verifiers (i.e., the miners/validators) do not have the PK of the account, but only its hash $h$.
In these settings, what the verifiers do is:
1. Receive only $(\sigma,m)$
2. Use the pubkey recovery algorithm to recover a set of PKs $S=\\{\pk_1,\ldots,\pk_\ell\\}$ under which $(\sigma,m)$ verifies
3. Check whether there exists a $\pk_i \in S$ such that $h=H(\pk_i)$. (This step is crucial.)
4. If so, they can consider the message $m$ (typically a TXN hash) as validly-signed under the PK $\pk_i$ hashed inside the address $h$[^P2PKH].

Let's try to figure out how pubkey recovery might work.
We know from the verification algorithm in Eq. \ref{eq:ecdsa-verify} that, given a correctly-computed ECDSA signature $(r,s)$, where $r=f(R)$, we have:
\begin{align}
f(R) &= f\left(\left(g^{H(m)} \pk^r\right)^{s^{-1}}\right)
\end{align}

Assume for a second that the function $f$ were [injective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function), which it is not. Then, the equation above would imply:
\begin{align}
R &= \left(g^{H(m)} \pk^r\right)^{s^{-1}}\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
R^s &= g^{H(m)} \pk^r\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
R^s / g^{H(m)} &= \pk^r\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
\label{eq:pubkey-recovery}
\left(R^s / g^{H(m)}\right)^{(r^{-1})} &= \pk\\\\\
\end{align}

This means that, for a correctly-computed $(r,s)$, we could invert $R = f^{-1}(r)$ and then extract the PK as per Eq. \ref{eq:pubkey-recovery}.

However, things are not so simple.

**Challenge 1:** First, as stated above, $f$ is **not** injective.
A little elliptic curve background is required to understand why.
The _tl;dr_ is that, given an $x$-coordinate of a point on an elliptic curve $E_{a,b}(\Fq): y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$, there are two possible $y$-coordinates that satisfy the equation: i.e., $y=\pm\sqrt{x^3 + ax+b}$. 

As a consequence, given the $x$-coordinate $x$ of $R$, we can extract two points $R$ and $R'$ such that $r=f(R)=f(R')$.
Plugging both of these possibilites for $R$ in Eq. \ref{eq:pubkey-recovery} now yields **two possible public keys**.
This is fine: it just means the signature verifies against either one.

**Challenge 2:** Above, we assumed we have the $x$-coordinate $x$ of $R$.
But the ECDSA signature does not include $x \in \Fq$; it only includes $\bar{x} \bmod p = r\in \Zp$, where $\bar{x}$ is the representation $x$ as an integer $\in [0,q)$. 
(Recall that $p$ is the order of the elliptic curve with base field $\Fq$.)
By Hasse's theorem[^hasse], we know that:

$$(q + 1) - 2\sqrt{q} \le p \le (q+1) + 2\sqrt{q}$$

So, it could be that $p \ge q$ or that $p < q$.

**Case 1:** If $p\ge q$, then given $r$, we can recover $x$ since the $\bar{x} \bmod p$ operation does not truncate $x$ when computing $r$.

**Case 2:** But, if $p < q$, it could be that $\bar{x} \in [0,q)$ was truncated when computing $r=\bar{x} \bmod p$ (i.e., it could be that $\bar{x} \ge p$).
By Hasse's theorem, $(q + 1) - 2\sqrt{q}\le p < q$.
Rearranging, we have $q - p \le 2\sqrt{q} - 1$.
Since $\bar{x} < q$, we have $\bar{x} - p < q - p$.
Therefore, we have $\bar{x} - p < 2\sqrt{q} - 1$, which is guaranteed to be smaller than $p$, since $p > 2\sqrt{q} - 1$ (again, by Hasse's theorem).
Therefore, the modular reduction $\bar{x} \bmod p$ can be computed as $\bar{x} - p$.
So, we only have two possible x-coordinates[^bitcoin-stex]:
\begin{align}
x_1 &= \bar{r} \in [0,q)\\\\\
x_2 &= (\bar{r} + p) \in [0, 2\sqrt{q})
\end{align}
<!-- 
Only need to do (\bar{r} + p), because |p - q| < 2\sqrt{q} 
-->
Then, each $x_i$ will have two possible y-coordinates: $y_i=\pm\sqrt{x_i^3 + ax_i + b}$.
And as a result, there are now four possible $R$'s to recover:
\begin{align}
R_1 &= (x_1, y_1)\\\\\
R_1' &= (x_1, -y_1)\\\\\
R_2 &= (x_2, y_2)\\\\\
R_2' &= (x_2, -y_2)\\\\\
\end{align}
To avoid the need to brute force all possible $R$ values, some systems like Ethereum, include a 2-bit **recovery ID** $v$ next to an ECDSA signature $(r,s)$.
This $v$ indicates to a verifier which one of the 4 values above should be computed as the actual $R$, saving precious signature verification computation. 
This is why, in online folklore, you will find ECDSA signatures described as a triple $(r,s,v)$.

### Recoverable algorithms

We describe the formal algorithms for pubkey recovery below.
Note that a new _augmented_ conversion function $f'$ is needed that computes the recovery ID $v$ for pubkey recovery.
This time, the conversion function is bijective and can be inverted, so we define both $f'$ and $f'^{-1}$ below.

$f'(R) \rightarrow (r,v)\in \Zp\times\\{0,1\\}^2$:
 1. Let $(x,y)\in\Fq^2$ denote the elliptic curve coordinates of point $R \in \Gr$
 1. $\mathsf{is\\_odd} \gets \bar{y} \bmod 2\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// 1 if $y$ is odd; 0 otherwise}}$
 1. $\mathsf{overflows} \gets (\bar{x} \ge \bar{p})\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// 1 if $\bar{x}\ge\bar{p}$; 0 otherwise}}$
 1. $r\gets \bar{x} - p\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// b.c., by Hasse's theorem, $(q + 1) - 2\sqrt{q}\le p < q\Rightarrow q - p \le 2\sqrt{q} - 1$}}$
 1. $v\gets (\mathsf{overflows}, \mathsf{is\\_odd})\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// MSB indicates overflow and LSB oddness}}$

{: .note}
The **recovery ID** $v$ stores (1) whether the reduction modulo $p$ wrapped around (i.e., "overflowed") in its most-significant bit and (2) whether $y$ is even or odd in its least-significant bit. This "oddness" bit will be used to determine which one of $\pm\sqrt{x^3 + ax + b}$ to set $y$ to.

{: .warning}
This blog-post's recovery ID is not encoded the same as in Ethereum or Bitcoin.
Recall that Ethereum's ECDSA signatures use the secp256k1 ellptic curve, which has $q > p$.
So, in theory, the recovery ID can be either 0, 1, 2, or 3.
In practice, though, Ethereum re-maps these 2-bit recovery IDs as just two numbers: 27 (for $v=0$) and 28 (for $v=1$), since the case of $\mathsf{overflows} \equals 1$ occurs with negligible probability when $R\randget g^k$ is picked randomly.
Recently, EIP-155[^eip-155] changed this encoding scheme to be $\mathsf{chain\\_id} \times 2 + (35 + v)$.
So, for mainnet with chain ID 1, the numbers are either 37 (for $v=0$) or 38 (for $v=1$).

$f'^{-1}(r,v) \rightarrow R \in \Gr$:
 1. $(\mathsf{overflows}, \mathsf{is\\_odd}) \gets v\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// parse recovery ID}}$
 1. **if** $\mathsf{overflows} \equals 0$, **then** $x\gets r$, **else** $x \gets (\bar{r} + p)$
	+ **Note:** The result $x$ is in $\Fq$
 1. $y\gets \sqrt{x^3 + ax + b}\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// $a$ and $b$ depend on the choice of elliptic curve $\Gr$}}$
 1. $b\gets \bar{y} \bmod 2$
 1. **if** $\mathsf{is\\_odd} \ne b$, **then** $y \gets (-y)\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// i.e., $q-y$}}$ 
	+ **Note:** The result $y$ is in $\Fq$
 1. $R\gets (x,y)$

$\mathsf{ECDSA}$.$\mathsf{RecoverableSign}(m, \sk) \rightarrow \sigma\in(0,p)^2 \times \\{0,1\\}^2$:
 1. $k \randget \Zp\setminus\\{0\\}\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// 0 is excluded as a valid nonce}}$
 1. $R\gets g^k$ 
 1. $(r,v)\gets f'(R)$ (see the _augmented_ conversion function above)
     - **if** $r\equals 0$, go back to **step 1**
 1. $s \gets k^{-1}(H(m) + \sk\cdot r) \bmod p$ 
     - **if** $s\equals 0$, go back to **step 1**
 1. $\sigma\gets (r,s,v)$

$\mathsf{ECDSA}$.$\mathsf{PubkeyRecover}(m, \sigma) \rightarrow \pk$:
 - $(r,s,v)\gets \sigma$
 - **assert** $r \in (0,p)$
 - **assert** $s \in (0,p)$
 - **assert** $v \in \\{0,1\\}^2$
 - $R \gets f'^{-1}(r, v)$
 - $\pk\gets \left(R^s / g^{H(m)}\right)^{(r^{-1})}$

## Batch verification

Recall from how ECDSA verification works in Eq. \ref{eq:ecdsa-verify} that a verifier must apply the conversion function $f$ over some computation and match against $r$:
\begin{align}
r &\equals f\left(\left(g^{H(m)} \pk^r\right)^{s^{-1}}\right)\Leftrightarrow
\end{align}
Unfortunately, the conversion function is not amenable to batching.
(Feel free to try!)
To address this, Cheon and Yi[^CY07] introduced **modified ECDSA**, a.k.a., **ECDSA$^\*$**.

The only difference is that, instead of including $r=f(R)$, modified ECDSA includes $R$ as part of the signature.
Therefore, signature verification no longer goes through the conversion function:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:modified-ecdsa-verify}
R \equals \left(g^{H(m)} \pk^r\right)^{s^{-1}}
\end{align}
As a result, a batch of signatures $$(R_i, s_i)_{i\in[n]}$$ for messages $$m_i$$ and PKs $$\pk_i$$ can be batch-verified using random coefficients $$\alpha_i\randget\Zp$$:
\begin{align}
\prod_{i\in[n]} R_i^{\alpha_i} \equals \prod_{i\in[n]} \left(g^{H(m_i)} \pk_i^{r_i}\right)^{s_i^{-1}\alpha_i}\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
1 \equals \prod_{i\in[n]} \left\[R_i^{-\alpha_i} \left(g^{H(m_i)} \pk_i^{r_i}\right)^{s_i^{-1}\alpha_i}\right\]\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
\label{eq:batch-verification}
1 \equals \prod_{i\in[n]} \left(R_i^{-\alpha_i} g^{H(m_i)\cdot s_i^{-1}\cdot \alpha_i} \pk^{r_i \cdot s_i^{-1}\cdot \alpha_i}\right)
\end{align}

### Batchable algorithms

We describe the modified ECDSA scheme that supports batch verification below. 
Changes from normal ECDSA are highlighted in $\red{\text{red}}$.

$\mathsf{ECDSA^\*}$.$\mathsf{Sign}(m, \sk) \rightarrow \sigma\in(\red{\Gr},\red{(0,p)})$:
 1. $k \randget \Zp\setminus\\{0\\}\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// 0 is excluded as a valid nonce}}$
 1. $R\gets g^k$ 
 1. $r\gets f(R)$ (again, see the [conversion function](#the-ecdsa-conversion-function) above)
     - **if** $r\equals 0$, go back to **step 1**
 1. $s \gets k^{-1}(H(m) + \sk\cdot r) \bmod p$ 
     - **if** $s\equals 0$, go back to **step 1**
 1. $\sigma\gets (\red{R},s)\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// no longer returns}}\ r$

$\textcolor{grey}{\text{// assumes}\ \pk\in \Gr}\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{of prime order}}$\
$\mathsf{ECDSA^\*}$.$\mathsf{Verify}(m, \pk, \sigma) \rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$:
 - $(\red{R},s)\gets \sigma$
 - assert $R$ is in the prime-order subgroup $\Gr$
 - **assert** $s \in (0,p)$
 - **assert** $\red{R \equals \left(g^{H(m)} \pk^r\right)^{s^{-1}}}\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// no longer using the conversion function}}\ f$


$\textcolor{grey}{\text{// assumes}\ \pk_i\in \Gr}\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{of prime order}}$\
$\mathsf{ECDSA^\*}$.$\mathsf{BatchVerify}((m_i, \pk_i, \sigma_i)_{i\in [n]}) \rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$:
 - $(R_i,s_i)\gets \sigma_i,\forall i\in [n]\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// implicitly asserts}\ R_i \in\Gr\ \text{of prime order}}$
 - **assert** $s_i \in (0,p),\forall i \in S$
 - $\alpha_i \randget \Zp,\forall i\in [n]$
 - assert $1 \equals \prod_{i\in[n]} \left(R_i^{-\alpha_i} g^{H(m_i)\cdot s_i^{-1}\cdot \alpha_i} \pk^{r_i \cdot s_i^{-1}\cdot \alpha_i}\right)$

{: .note}
The most efficient implementation would use **batch inversion**[^inv-tweet] to compute all the $s_i^{-1}$'s.
Then, it would compute all the exponents in the right-hand side in Eq. \ref{eq:batch-verification}.
Finally, it would compute this right-hand side via a size-$3n$ multi-exponentiation.

## Signature malleability 

In elliptic curves, the inverse of a point $R=(x,y)\in\Fq^2$ is computed as $R^{-1} = (x,-y)\in\Fq^2$.
Unfortunately, [the ECDSA conversion function](#the-ecdsa-conversion-function) only computes on the $x$-coordinate and ignores the $y$-coordinate!
This means that:
\begin{align}
f(R) = f(R^{-1})
\end{align}
As a result, the ECDSA verification in Eq. \ref{eq:ecdsa-verify} will pass both for $(r,s)\in (0,p)$ as well as for $(r,\red{p-s})\in(0,p)$!
To see this, just substitute $\red{-s}$ for $s$ in Eq. \ref{eq:ecdsa-verify-2}:
\begin{align}
r &\equals f\left(g^{(\red{-s})^{-1}(H(m) + \sk \cdot r)}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &\equals f\left(g^{(-1)^{-1}s^{-1}(H(m) + \sk \cdot r)}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &\equals f\left(g^{-s^{-1}(H(m) + \sk \cdot r)}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &\equals f\left(g^{-\left(k^{-1}(H(m)+\sk\cdot r)\right)^{-1}(H(m) + \sk \cdot r)}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &\equals f\left(g^{-\left(k^{-1}\right)^{-1}}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &\equals f\left(g^{-k}\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
r &\equals f(R^{-1})\\\\\
r &\equals f(R)
\end{align}
Note that this attack applies to the [modified ECDSA](#batch-verification) scheme above too, since a valid signature $(R,s)$ can be mauled as $(\red{R^{-1}}, \red{-s})$.

{: .info}
_Historical aside:_
Malleability attacks may have played a small role in the MtGox attacks[^DW14], where \$620 million worth of Bitcoin disappeared.
However, the predominant theory is that there is other funny business that accounts for most of the stolen funds[^mtgox].

{: .note}
There can be other sources of malleability too: e.g., perhaps implementations forget to check that $r\in(0,q)$.
Or, implementations may allow multiple serializations for the same $r$.

### Non-malleable algorithms

There are two ways to fix non-malleability.
 1. **Approach 1:** Observe that for any $s\in(0,p)$ if $s$ is even, then $p-s$ is odd. (And if $s$ is odd, then $p-s$ is even.)
    Therefore, by convention, only allow even $s$ and enforce this in the signature verification algorithm.
 1. **Approach 2:** Observe that for any $s\in(0,(p-1)/2]$, we have $p-s \in ((p-1)/2, p)$.
    Therefore, by convention, only allow $s\in(0,(p-1)/2]$ and enforce this in the signature verification algorithm.
     + e.g., when $p=5$, if $s\in(0,2]=\\{1,2\\}$, then $p-s \in (2,5)=\\{3,4\\}$

We give algorithms for **approach 2** below.
Everything remains mostly the same, except for the $\red{\text{red}}$ parts:

$\mathsf{ECDSA}$.$\mathsf{Sign^\red{\*}}(m, \sk) \rightarrow \sigma\in(0,p)\times\red{(0,(p-1)/2]}$:
 1. $k \randget \Zp\setminus\\{0\\}\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{// 0 is excluded as a valid nonce}}$
 1. $R\gets g^k$ 
 1. $r\gets f(R)$ (again, see the [conversion function](#the-ecdsa-conversion-function) above)
     - **if** $r\equals 0$, go back to **step 1**
 1. $s \gets k^{-1}(H(m) + \sk\cdot r) \bmod p$ 
     - **if** $s\equals 0$, go back to **step 1**
     - **if** $\red{s > (p - 1)/2}$, go back to **step 1**
 1. $\sigma\gets (r,s)$

$\textcolor{grey}{\text{// assumes}\ \pk\in \Gr}\ \textcolor{grey}{\text{of prime order}}$\
$\mathsf{ECDSA}$.$\mathsf{\red{NonMalleable}Verify}(m, \pk, \sigma) \rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$:
 - $(r,s)\gets \sigma$
 - **assert** $r \in (0,p)$
 - **assert** $\red{s \in (0,(p-1)/2]}$
 - **assert** $r \equals f\left(\left(g^{H(m)} \pk^r\right)^{s^{-1}}\right)$

## Implementation caveats

Implementing ECDSA securely and efficiently can be tricky:

 1. Must remember to verify that $r$ and $s$ are not $0$
 1. Must be wary of [signature malleability attacks](#signature-malleability)
 1. If not using prime-order groups, prime-order subgroup membership checks must be performed on...
     - ...the PKs passed into the verification equation
     - ...the $R$-component of [modified ECDSA](#batch-verification) signatures
 1. Should aim to use efficient inversion algorithms[^inv-tweet] for $s^{-1}$ (e.g., EEA-based, Lehmer) 
 1. ECDSA, like [Schnorr](/schnorr-signatures), is broken if the **nonce $k$ is reused**. Generally, they are both very **fragile** if the nonce $k$ is biased[^BH19e].
    + Even small amounts of bias in the nonce $k$ can be used to recover the SK given enough signatures.
    - Deterministic signing can mitigate this in both schemes[^deterministic-ecdsa].
 1. ECDSA is more vulnerable to timing attacks[^minerva]

## Why you should avoid ECDSA

**Hot take 🌶️:** There is **no** good reason to ever use ECDSA (except for legacy compatibility). 
As far as I can tell, [Schnorr signatures should always be preferred over it!](/schnorr-vs-ecdsa)

{: .note}
Although ECDSA can be very fragile in the face of side-channels (e.g., see extracting ECDSA keys from Yubikeys[^eea-side-channel]), it is not clear to what extent other schemes would fare better. For example, both [Schnorr](/schnorr-signatures) and BLS[^BLS01] do exponentiations with secrets.

## Conclusion

Despite my strong bias against ECDSA, I still find it to be a cool signature scheme:

 1. (I believe?) ECDSA was the first **wide-deployment** of elliptic-curve cryptography
 1. ECDSA does not use the Fiat-Shamir transform[^FS87]
 1. ElGamal signatures (and thus [EC]DSA) are one of the few paradigms for signature schemes in the prime-order group setting without pairings
     + Besides Fiat-Shamir-style signatures from $\Sigma$-protocols (e.g., Schnorr[^Schn89], Chaum-Pedersen[^CP92], Okamoto[^Okam93]), what else is there?
        * Oh! Dan Boneh pointed me to **Nyberg-Rueppel** signatures[^NR95].
 1. ECDSA showcased the utility of [pubkey recovery](#pubkey-recovery) algorithms in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum

### Future work

Other items I hope to address in the future:

 - The necessity of random oracles in ElGamal/DSA to prevent [existential forgeries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_signature_scheme#Existential_forgery) (also [here](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/35684/el-gamal-existential-forgery-using-pointcheval-stern-signature-algorithm))
 - I hope to write down a reasonable proof of ECDSA's EUF-CMA security.
 - Other [summaries of why ECDSA is very feeble](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2020/06/11/ecdsa-handle-with-care/).
 - Look into [Shamir trick stuff](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/47627/goofs-that-could-creep-in-ecdsa-signature-verification)
 - Address implementations checking that $R$ is not the identity
 - An unecessary check that [the PK is not the identity](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/74354/ecdsa-signature-verification-checks) during verification
 - Incorporate more insights from SEC 1: Elliptic curve cryptography[^sec-1]

## Appendix: libsecp256k1's ECDSA pubkey recovery code (Rust)

For my own benefit (and hopefully yours too, especially if you are an Ethereum developer), I am including `libsecp256k1`'s[^libsecp256k1] Rust code (used in [Aptos](https://x.com/aptos)) to showcase how (recoverable) signing and pubkey recovery are typically implemented.

Note that I've added some instructional comments to the code.

{: .note}
In this blog post, I use $\Fq$ for the base field of the elliptic curve and $p$ for its order.
However, the `libsecp256k1` code has these flipped.
Nonetheless, my comments assume my terminology where $(x,y)\in\Fq^2$ and the order of the curve is $p$. 

### Recoverable signing

```rust
pub fn sign_raw(
	&self,
	seckey: &Scalar,
	message: &Scalar,
	nonce: &Scalar,
) -> Result<(Scalar, Scalar, u8), Error> {
	let mut rp = Jacobian::default();
	self.ecmult_gen(&mut rp, nonce);
	let mut r = Affine::default();
	r.set_gej(&rp);
	r.x.normalize();
	r.y.normalize();
	// This is the x coordinate of R, in F_q, but viewed as a big-endian integer
	let b = r.x.b32();
	let mut sigr = Scalar::default();
	// This does the R.x mod p reduction (p = the order of the curve)
	let overflow = bool::from(sigr.set_b32(&b));
	debug_assert!(!sigr.is_zero());
	// This debug-only asserts that R.x was less than < p and so there was no modular reduction
	// that actually happened. I guess the developers left this here because they know that,
	// while this can happen, it only happens with negligible probability due to uniformity of
	// the nonce and the fact that p < (q+1) + 2\sqrt{q}, so the probability that it overflows
	// goes to zero as q gets larger. Specifically, the probability is 1 - \frac{q}{(q+1) + 2\sqrt{q}}
	//
	debug_assert!(!overflow);

	// This sets the recid = (overflow << 1) | R.y.is_odd())
	// i.e., the MSB is the overflow bit and the LSB is the oddness bit
	let mut recid = (if overflow { 2 } else { 0 }) | (if r.y.is_odd() { 1 } else { 0 });
	let mut n = &sigr * seckey;
	n += message;
	let mut sigs = nonce.inv();
	sigs *= &n;
	n.clear();
	rp.clear();
	r.clear();
	if sigs.is_zero() {
		return Err(Error::InvalidMessage);
	}
	if sigs.is_high() {
		sigs = -sigs;
		recid ^= 1;
	}
	Ok((sigr, sigs, recid))
}
```

### Pubkey recovery

```rust
pub fn recover_raw(
	&self,
	sigr: &Scalar,
	sigs: &Scalar,
	rec_id: u8,
	message: &Scalar,
) -> Result<Affine, Error> {
	debug_assert!(rec_id < 4);

	if sigr.is_zero() || sigs.is_zero() {
		return Err(Error::InvalidSignature);
	}

	// Parse the signature's r as an integer
	let brx = sigr.b32();
	// Create an F_q element for storing the x-coordiante of R recovered from r
	let mut fx = Field::default();
	let overflow = fx.set_b32(&brx);
	// This would indicate that an r >= q was used, which would be an error.
	debug_assert!(overflow);

	// If there was an "overflow" during the reduction mod p, then account for it.
	if rec_id & 2 > 0 {
		// P_MINUS_ORDER, in our terminology, is (q - p), where:
 		//  - q is the order of the base field
		//  - p is the order of the curve
		if fx >= P_MINUS_ORDER {
			return Err(Error::InvalidSignature);
		}
		// Accounts for the overflow by setting fx = (\bar{r} + p) and (eventually) reducing mod q
		fx += ORDER_AS_FE;
	}

	// Recovers the elliptic curve point R = (x, y) from the x-coordinate x and the oddness bit
	let mut x = Affine::default();
	if !x.set_xo_var(&fx, rec_id & 1 > 0) {
		return Err(Error::InvalidSignature);
	}
	let mut xj = Jacobian::default();
	xj.set_ge(&x);
	let rn = sigr.inv();
	let mut u1 = &rn * message;
	u1 = -u1;
	let u2 = &rn * sigs;
	let mut qj = Jacobian::default();
	self.ecmult(&mut qj, &xj, &u2, &u1);

	let mut pubkey = Affine::default();
	pubkey.set_gej_var(&qj);

	if pubkey.is_infinity() {
		Err(Error::InvalidSignature)
	} else {
		Ok(pubkey)
	}
}
```
