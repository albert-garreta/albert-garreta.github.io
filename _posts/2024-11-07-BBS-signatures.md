**tl;dr:** 
Do you want to sign (committed) field elements without relying on random oracles?
Do you want to efficiently prove (in zero-knowledge) relations over your signed messages?
BBS+ is here to help you!

The **BBS+ signature scheme** is a transformation[^ASM08e] of the the _Boneh-Boyen-Shacham (BBS)_ **group** signature scheme[^BBS04] into a **standalone** signature scheme.

This blog post describes BBS+ as well as a recent improvement over it dubbed **standalone BBS**[^TZ23e].

## Why BBS+?

Both [BBS+](#the-bbs-signature-scheme) and [standalone BBS](#the-standalone-bbs-signature-scheme) have really **nice properties**:

 - Can sign a vector of field elements $(m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_\ell)\in \Zp$
   + The signing [can be done blindly](#how-to-sign-blindly-in-bbs) over a Pedersen vector commitment to the elements
   + This way, the signer gets the commitment to sign and never sees the messages $m_i$ themselves
 - Does not rely on random oracles
   + As a result, it admits efficient protocols for proving knowledge of a signature over a (committed) message
 - It is almost as fast to verify as BLS[^BLS01] signatures: a size-2 multipairing, a size-$(\ell+1)$ $\Gr_1$ multiexp, and one $\Gr_1$ exponentiation
 - It admits fast batch verification of signatures under the same public key

These properties makes BBS+ (and standalone BBS) very useful for building **anonymous credential (AC)** schemes.
(In a future post, I hope to constrast BBS+ with other schemes like CL or [Pointcheval-Sanders (PS)](/2023/01/08/Pairing-based-anonymous-credentials-and-the-power-of-re-randomization.html).)

For some of the disadvantages, see the [conclusion](#conclusion).

## Preliminaries
 
 - There is a [bilinear map](/pairings) $e : \Gr_1 \times \Gr_2 \rightarrow \Gr_T$, where $\Gr_1 = \langle g_1 \rangle, \Gr_2 = \langle g_2 \rangle$ and $\Gr_T$ are of prime order $p$
 - Let $\Zp = \\{0,1,2,\ldots,p-1\\}$ denote the finite field of order $p$. 
 - A Pedersen commitment to a vector $(m_1,\ldots,m_\ell) \in \Zp^\ell$ is $C = h_0^r \prod_{i\in[\ell]} h_i^{m_i}$, where $r \randget \Zp$ is a uniformly-picked blinding factor and $(h_0,\ldots,h_\ell)$ are fixed generators in a group $\Gr$ of order $p$ whose pairwise discrete logs are unknown.
 - The [blind signing](#how-to-sign-blindly-in-bbs) subsection(s) assume familiarity with ZKPoKs of Pedersen commitment openings.
    + We use two algorithms for this $\mathsf{ZK}.\mathsf{ProveKnowledge}$ to create a proof and $\mathsf{ZK}.\mathsf{VerifyProofOfKnowledge}$ to verify it

## The BBS+ signature scheme

{: .info}
_Note:_ BBS+ is slightly less efficient than [standalone BBS](#the-standalone-bbs-signature-scheme), so it should probably be dropped in favor of the latter.

$\mathsf{BBS+}$.$\mathsf{KeyGen}(1^\lambda, \ell) \rightarrow (\sk, \pk)$:
 - $\mathbf{h} \stackrel{\mathsf{def}}{=} (h_0, h_1 \ldots, h_{\ell}) \gets \Gr_1^{\ell+1}$
 - $x \randget \Zp$
 - $y \gets g_2^x$
 - $\sk \gets (x, \mathbf{h})$
 - $\pk \gets (y, \mathbf{h})$

$\mathsf{BBS+}$.$\mathsf{Sign}((m_1,\ldots,m_\ell), \sk) \rightarrow \sigma$:
 - $(x, \mathbf{h}) \gets \sk$
 - $(e, s)\randget \Zp^2$
 - $C \gets g_1 h_0^s \prod_{i\in[\ell]} h_i^{m_i}$
    + **Note:** This is a Pedersen-like commitment to the $m_i$'s. (Except it is not blinded, since the randomness $s$ is publicly-exposed as part of the signature.)
 - $\sigma \stackrel{\mathsf{def}}{=} (A, e, s) \gets \left(C^\frac{1}{x + e}, e, s\right)$

{: .info}
The randomness $s$ is needed to prove BBS+ secure. Fortunately, the recent [stBBS](#the-standalone-bbs-signature-scheme) variant can be proven secure without such an $s$, which results in slightly faster signing and smaller signatures!

$\mathsf{BBS+}$.$\mathsf{Verify}((m_1,\ldots,m_\ell), \pk, \sigma) \rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$:
 - $(y,\mathbf{h})\gets \pk$ 
 - $(A, e, s)\gets \sigma$
 - $C \gets g_1 h_0^s \prod_{i\in[\ell]} h_i^{m_i}$
 - **assert** $e(A, y \cdot g_2^e) \equals e(C, g_2)$


**Correctness:**
It is easy to see why correctness holds (i.e., signatures produced by $\mathsf{BBS+}.\mathsf{Sign}$ pass verification in $\mathsf{BBS+}.\mathsf{Verify}$):
\begin{align}
e(A, y \cdot g_2^e) &\equals e(C, g_2)\\\\\
e\left(C^\frac{1}{x + e}, g_2^x \cdot g_2^e\right) &\equals e(C, g_2)\\\\\
e\left(C^\frac{1}{x + e}, g_2^{x + e}\right) &\equals e(C, g_2)\\\\\
e(C, g_2) &\equals e(C, g_2)
\end{align}

**Existential unforgeability under chosen message attack (EUF-CMA):** Unfortunately, it is not so easy to see why the scheme is secure. For the curious reader, a security proof can be found in Appendix B of the original paper[^ASM08e].

### How to batch verify in BBS+

BBS+ admits a faster **batch verification** algorithm when verifying a batch of $b$ signatures, all under the same public key.
This algorithm outputs 1 if **all** signatures verify or outputs 0 if one of the signatures does not.
(To identify the bad signature(s), one typically naively re-verifies all signatures individually, or resorts to fancier techniques[^LM07].)

The key observation is that given a bunch of signatures:

$$(A_j, e_j, s_j)\gets \sigma_j,\forall j\in[b]$$

...each over a commitment $C_j$, the verification equation for each signature can be decomposed as follows:
\begin{align}
e(A_j, y \cdot g_2^{e_j}) &\equals e(C_j, g_2)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
e(A_j, y) e(A_j, g_2^{e_j}) &\equals e(C_j, g_2)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
e(A_j, y) e(A_j^{e_j}, g_2) &\equals e(C_j, g_2)
\end{align}

As a result, to verify this equation holds for all $j\in[b]$, we can combine all equations into one via a linear combination with random coefficients $(\alpha_1, \alpha_2,\ldots,\alpha_b)$:
\begin{align}
\prod_{j\in[b]} \left(e(A\_j, y) e(A\_j^{e_j}, g\_2)\right)^{\alpha\_j} &\equals \prod_{j\in[b]} e(C\_j, g_2)^{\alpha_j}\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
\prod_{j\in[b]} e(A\_j^{\alpha\_j}, y) e\left((A\_j^{e_j})^{\alpha\_j}, g\_2\right) &\equals \prod_{j\in[b]} e(C\_j^{\alpha_j}, g_2)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
e\left(\prod_{j\in[b]} A\_j^{\alpha\_j}, y\right) e\left(\prod_{j\in[b]} A\_j^{e_j \alpha\_j}, g\_2\right) &\equals e\left(\prod_{j\in[b]} C\_j^{\alpha_j}, g_2\right)\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
e\left(\prod_{j\in[b]} A\_j^{\alpha\_j}, y\right) &\equals e\left(\prod_{j\in[b]} C\_j^{\alpha_j}, g_2\right) e\left(\prod_{j\in[b]} A\_j^{e_j \alpha\_j}, g\_2\right)^{-1}\Leftrightarrow\\\\\
e\left(\prod_{j\in[b]} A\_j^{\alpha\_j}, y\right) &\equals e\left(\prod_{j\in[b]} A\_j^{-e_j \alpha\_j} C\_j^{\alpha_j}, g_2\right) \Leftrightarrow\\\\\
\end{align}

The full batch verification algorithms follows below:

$\mathsf{BBS+}$.$\mathsf{BatchVerify}((m\_{j,1},\ldots,m\_{j,\ell})\_{j\in[b]}, \pk, (\sigma_j)\_{j\in [b]}) \rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$:
 - $(y,\mathbf{h})\gets \pk$ 
 - $(A_j, e_j, s_j)\gets \sigma_j,\forall j\in[b]$
 - $(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_b)\randget \Zp^b$
 - $M \gets \prod_{j\in[b]} A_j^{-e_j \alpha_j} C_j^{\alpha_j}$, where $C_j = g_1 h_0^{s_j} \prod_{i\in[\ell]} h_i^{m_{j,i}}$
     - Note that $M$ can be carefully-computed in a single size-$\left(b(\ell+3)\right)$ multiexp!
 - **assert** $e\left(\prod_{j\in[b]} A\_j^{\alpha\_j}, y\right) \equals e\left(M, g_2\right)$

### How to sign blindly in BBS+

We will introduce some new algorithms to allow for the _blind signing_ flow, which works as follows:
1. The user, who is trying to get the signature, uses a new $\mathsf{BBS+}$.$\mathsf{Commit}$ algorithm to produce a blinded Pedersen commitment $C$ (with blinder $s_1$) to the messages he is trying to sign without revealing.
2. The user sends the commitment $C$ together with a ZKPoK of opening $\pi$ to the signer.
3. The signer calls a new $\mathsf{BBS+}$.$\mathsf{BlindSign}$ algorithm on this commitment $C$ and the proof $\pi$.
4. This algorithm verifies the proof $\pi$ against $C$ and returns a blind signature $(A, e, s_2)$.
5. The user unblinds this signature by calling $\mathsf{BBS+}.\mathsf{Unblind}$ on $(A, e, s_2)$ and the commitment blinder $s_1$.
6. The final (unblinded) signature is $(A, e, s) \bydef (A, e, s_1 + s_2)$.

The new algorithms follow below:

$\mathsf{BBS+}$.$\mathsf{Commit}((m_1,\ldots,m_\ell); s_1) \rightarrow (C,\pi)$:
 - $C \gets h_0^{s_1} \prod_{i\in[\ell]} h_i^{m_i}$
 - $\pi \gets \mathsf{ZK}.\mathsf{ProveKnowledge}\left((s_1, m_1, \ldots, m_\ell) : C = h_0^{s_1} \prod_{i\in[\ell]} h_i^{m_i}\right)$

{: .info}
**Note:** This is a properly-blinded Pedersen commitment. There is no $g_1$ component; it will be added later during signing.


$\mathsf{BBS+}$.$\mathsf{BlindSign}(C, \pi) \rightarrow (A, e, s_2)$:
 - **assert** $\mathsf{ZK}.\mathsf{VerifyProofOfKnowledge}(C, \pi) \equals 1$
 - $s_2\randget \Zp$
 - $e\randget\Zp$
 - $A \gets (g_1 h_0^{s_2} \cdot C)^\frac{1}{x+e}$

$\mathsf{BBS+}.\mathsf{Unblind}(A, e, s_1, s_2) \rightarrow \sigma$
 - $\sigma \gets (A, e, s_1 + s_2)$

{: .info}
**Note:** $\mathsf{BBS+}.\mathsf{Unblind}$ returns a BBS+ signature that can be verified via $\mathsf{BBS+}.\mathsf{Verify}$. The nice thing is that the signer did not learn the signed messages, since it only saw (and blindly-signed) a Pedersen commitment to these messages. However, beware that once $\sigma = (A, e, s_1 + s_2)$ is revealed, the signer learns $s_1$, can unblind the commitment $C$, and brute-force the messages $m_i$. As a result, some privacy-preserving protocols aim to never reveal the signature $\sigma$. Instead, they reveal a zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge (ZKPoK) of such a signature over messages that satisfy useful properties in these protocols. This can be done very efficiently via $\Sigma$ protocols.


## The standalone BBS signature scheme

BBS+ was a transformation of the BBS group signature scheme[^BBS04] into a standalone signature scheme by Au et al.[^ASM08e].
Unfortunately, BBS+ signature sizes are larger: from $(A, e)\in\Gr\times\Zp$ to $(A, e, s)\in\Gr\times\Zp^2$.
Interestingly, the $s$ component only had to be included so that the security proof could pass.

Recently, Tessaro and Zhu[^TZ23e] fixed this in a new variant dubbed **standalone BBS signatures**.
First, they gave a (non-tight) security proof for the **strong** existential unforgeability of standalone BBS, under the $q$-SDH assumption, assuming the $e$'s are randomly picked (see Theorem 1 in [TZ23e][^TZ23e]).
Second, they gave a tight security proof in the algebraic group model (AGM)[^FKL18], additionally allowing for unique, deterministically-generated $e$'s (see Theorem 2 in [TZ23e][^TZ23e]).
This suggests that the loss in tightness in the original proof may be artificial.
Third, they proved that standalone BBS signatures are secure even when directly signing Pedersen commitments (see Theorem 3 in [TZ23e][^TZ23e]).
So one can regard them as a kind of weaker structure-preserving signatures.
(Note that they are **not** secure for signing arbitrary group elements, since a signature $(A, e)$ on a group element $C$ can be easily mauled into a new signature $(A^2, e)$ on $C^2$.)

{: .info}
I guess the alternative BBS++ name would have been worse?
On the other hand "[standalone] BBS"[^TZ23e] stands to be confused with the BBS [group] signature scheme[^BBS04].

Naming issues aside, Tessaro and Zhu's **standalone BBS (stBBS)** scheme's decription follows below.
(It is denoted as $\mathsf{stBBS}$ to avoid confusing it with the $\mathsf{BBS}$ group signature scheme.)

$\mathsf{stBBS}$.$\mathsf{KeyGen}(1^\lambda, \ell) \rightarrow (\sk, \pk)$:
 - (This is almost the same as in BBS+, except only $\ell$ $h_i$'s are needed.)
 - $\mathbf{h} \stackrel{\mathsf{def}}{=} (h_1, \ldots, h_\ell) \gets \Gr_1^{\ell}$
 - $x \randget \Zp$
 - $y \gets g_2^x$
 - $\sk \gets (x, \mathbf{h})$
 - $\pk \gets (y, \mathbf{h})$

$\mathsf{stBBS}$.$\mathsf{Sign}((m_1,\ldots,m_\ell), \sk) \rightarrow \sigma$:
 - $(x, \mathbf{h}) \gets \sk$
 - $e\randget \Zp$
 - $C \gets g_1 \prod_{i\in[\ell]} h_i^{m_i}$
    + **Note:** This is a Pedersen-like commitment to the $m_i$'s. (Except it is not blinded.)
 - $\sigma \stackrel{\mathsf{def}}{=} (A, e) \gets \left(C^\frac{1}{x + e}, e\right)$

{: .info}
Signing is slightly faster than in BBS+ because there is no $h_0^s$

$\mathsf{stBBS}$.$\mathsf{Verify}((m_1,\ldots,m_\ell), \pk, \sigma) \rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$:
 - $(y,\mathbf{h})\gets \pk$ 
 - $(A, e)\gets \sigma$
 - $C \gets g_1 \prod_{i\in[\ell]} h_i^{m_i}$
 - **assert** $e(A, y \cdot g_2^e) \equals e(C, g_2)$

### How to batch verify in stBSS

Much like [BBS+](#how-to-batch-verify-in-bbs), stBBS also admits a similar batch verification algorithm:

$\mathsf{BBS+}$.$\mathsf{BatchVerify}((m\_{j,1},\ldots,m\_{j,\ell})\_{j\in[b]}, \pk, (\sigma_j)\_{j\in [b]}) \rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$:
 - $(y,\mathbf{h})\gets \pk$ 
 - $(A_j, e_j)\gets \sigma_j,\forall j\in[b]$
 - $(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_b)\randget \Zp^b$
 - $M \gets \prod_{j\in[b]} A_j^{-e_j \alpha_j} C_j^{\alpha_j}$, where $C_j = g_1 \prod_{i\in[\ell]} h_i^{m_{j,i}}$
     - Note that $M$ can be carefully-computed in a single size-$\left(b(\ell+2)\right)$ multiexp!
 - **assert** $e\left(\prod_{j\in[b]} A\_j^{\alpha\_j}, y\right) \equals e\left(M, g_2\right)$

### How to sign blindly in stBBS

Blind-signing in stBBS works only slightly differently than in [BBS+](#how-to-sign-blindly-in-bbs)
This is because stBBS signatures lack the $s$ component.
As a result, one of the signed messages themselves has to be used as Pedersen commitment blinder.
Nonetheless, the blind-signing flow remains largely the same as in [BBS+](#how-to-sign-blindly-in-bbs):
1. The user, who is trying to get the signature, uses a new $\mathsf{stBBS}$.$\mathsf{Commit}$ algorithm to produce a blinded Pedersen commitment $C$ (with blinder $r$) to the secret messages $(m_1, m_2,\ldots,m_{\ell-1})$ he is trying to.
   + Note that there are $\ell-1$ instead of $\ell$ messages because the last message $m_\ell$ will be set to the blinder $r$.
2. The user sends the commitment $C$ together with a ZKPoK of opening $\pi$ to the signer.
3. The signer calls a new $\mathsf{stBBS}$.$\mathsf{BlindSign}$ algorithm on this commitment $C$ and the proof $\pi$.
4. This algorithm verifies the proof $\pi$ against $C$ and returns an stBBS signature $\sigma = (A, e)$ over the messages $(m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_{\ell-1}, r)$. (Note that the blinder $r$ is part of the signed message.)

The algorithms are described below:

$\mathsf{stBBS}$.$\mathsf{Commit}((m_1,\ldots,m_{\ell - 1}); r) \rightarrow (C,\pi)$:
 - $C \gets \left(\prod_{i\in[\ell-1]} h_i^{m_i}\right) h_\ell^r$
 - $\pi \gets \mathsf{ZK}.\mathsf{ProveKnowledge}\left((s_1, m_1, \ldots, m_{\ell-1}, r) : C = (\prod_{i\in[\ell-1]} h_i^{m_i}) h_\ell^r \right)$

$\mathsf{stBBS}$.$\mathsf{BlindSign}(C, \pi) \rightarrow \sigma$:
 - **assert** $\mathsf{ZK}.\mathsf{VerifyProofOfKnowledge}(C, \pi) \equals 1$
 - $e\randget\Zp$
 - $A \gets (g_1 \cdot C)^\frac{1}{x+e}$
 - $\sigma \gets (A, e)$

{: .info}
**Note:** There is no need to unblind the signature here, unlike in [BBS+](#how-to-sign-blindly-in-bbs).

{: .info}
Note that the signature verification is done as $\mathsf{stBBS}$.$\mathsf{Verify}((m_1,\ldots,m_{\ell-1},r), \pk, \sigma)$ and accounts for the blinder $r$ as one of the signed messages!

### How to pick $e$'s simply and securely

If one is comfortable with the AGM, then you no longer need to pick $e$ uniformly at random. Instead, you only need to make sure $e$'s don't collide. The simplest way is to treat $e$ as an always-increasing counter. Or, to derive it pseudo-randomly (via hashing) from the signed message (in the non-blinded variant) or the signed commitment (in the blinded variant).

{: .warning}
**Warning:** Avoiding collisions is really key: reusing $e$ leads to a forgery attack! Given a signature $\sigma_1 = \left(C_1^\frac{1}{x+e}, e\right)$, if $e$ is reused to create another signature $\sigma_2 = \left(C_2^\frac{1}{x+e},e\right)$, then an attacker can combine these into a signature $\sigma = \left((C_1 \cdot C_2)^\frac{1}{x+e}, e\right)$. If $C_1$ commits to $(m_1,\ldots, m_\ell)$ and $C_2$ commits to $(m_1',\ldots,m_\ell')$, then  the forged signature $\sigma$ would be over a commitment to $(m_1 + m_1', \ldots, m_\ell + m_\ell')$. In many applications, such as anonymous credentials or anonymous payment systems[^TBAplus22e], this would break security.

## Conclusion

BBS+ and standalone BBS are versatile signature schemes (e.g., can sign [commitments to] field element(s) without random oracles, can verify almost as fast as BLS[^BLS01], etc.).

However, like any signature scheme, they have their **disadvantages**:
 - **Larger signatures** for BBS+: 1 group element and 2 field elements.
    + Standalone BBS has _smaller_ signatures: 1 group element and 1 field element.
 - They **do not "thresholdize" very well**: $t$-out-of-$n$ threshold protocols for BBS+ (and standalone BBS) either require offline preprocessing or multiple rounds of interaction between signers.
 - Signing **requires picking randomness $e$** (although [stBBS's AGM proof](#how-to-pick-es-simply-and-securely) relaxes this to picking unique $e$'s).
 - Signatures are **not re-randomizable**[^PS16]. (It may be sufficient to expose $h_0^\frac{1}{x+e}$ next to each signature $(A,e)$ to allow for re-randomizability?)
