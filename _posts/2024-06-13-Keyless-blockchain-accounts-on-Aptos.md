**tl;dr:** What is a **keyless blockchain account**?
Put simply, _"Your blockchain account = Your Google account"_. 
In other words, this keyless approach allows you to derive a blockchain account from any of your existing OpenID Connect (OIDC) account (e.g., Google, Apple), rather than from a traditional secret key or mnemonic. 
There are no long-term secret keys you need to manage.
There is also no multi-party computation (MPC) system managing your account for you.
As a result, the risk of account loss is (more or less), the risk of losing your Google account.
Keyless is built using a [Groth16](/groth16) zero-knowledge proof to maintain privacy in both directions: prevent the blockchain from learning anything about your Google account & prevent Google from learning anything about your blockchain account and transaction activity.

One day, I hope to edit this into a full blog post but, until then, here's a bunch of resources.


## Drawings

### Keyless on-chain verification

Depicts what the blockchain validators need to do to verify a keyless TXN submitted by a user, Alice.

### End-to-end keyless flow (with zero-knowledge)

Depicts the full keyless flow: the user generating an ESK and EPK, the user signing into the dapp with the EPK as the OIDC `nonce`, the dapp getting a JWT, exchanging it for a pepper, getting a ZKP from the prover service, the user signing a TXN with their ESK, the dapp sending the TXN containing the ZKP and ephemeral signature, and finally the blockchain verifying everything.

### Keyless ZK relation

The ZK relation needed for keyless:

### Oblivious pepper service ZK relation

The ZK relation needed to implement an [oblivious pepper service][oblivious-pepper]:

### End-to-end-keyless flow (without zero-knowledge)

In case of emergency, keyless supports a **ZKless** mode that is **not** privacy preserving.

We depicts this (simpler) ZKless flow: the user generating an ESK and EPK, the user signing into the dapp with the EPK as the OIDC `nonce`, the dapp getting a JWT, the user signing a TXN with their ESK, the dapp sending the TXN containing the ephemeral signature, and finally the blockchain verifying everything.

## Write-ups

1. I wrote a [high-level overview](https://aptos.dev/en/build/guides/aptos-keyless/how-keyless-works) of how keyless accounts work on the [Aptos](https://twitter.com/aptos) blockchain 
2. I wrote an [in-depth explanation](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-61.md) of how keyless accounts work (and their many caveats) in the 61st Aptos Improvement Proposal.

## Aptos Improvement Proposals (AIPs)

AIPs for auxiliary keyless services:

 - [AIP-75: Prover service](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-75.md)
 - [AIP-81: Pepper service](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-81.md)
 - [AIP-67: Native JWK consensus](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-67.md)

AIPs for recent extensions to keyless:

 - [AIP-96: Federated Keyless](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-96.md)
    + Adds decentralized support for "federated" OIDC providers like Auth0, which have tenant-specific `iss`'s and JWKs and could not be scalably integrated into our [JWK consensus](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-67.md) mechanism
 - [AIP-108: "Audless" Federated Keyless](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-108.md)
 - Draft [AIP: Oblivious pepper service][oblivious-pepper]
