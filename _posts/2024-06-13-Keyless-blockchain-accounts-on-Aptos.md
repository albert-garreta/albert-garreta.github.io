**tl;dr:** What is a **keyless blockchain account**?
Put simply, _"Your blockchain account = Your Google account"_. 
In other words, this keyless approach allows you to derive a blockchain account from any of your existing OpenID Connect (OIDC) account (e.g., Google, Apple), rather than from a traditional secret key or mnemonic. 
There are no long-term secret keys you need to manage.
There is also no multi-party computation (MPC) system managing your account for you.
As a result, the risk of account loss is (more or less), the risk of losing your Google account.

One day, I hope to edit this into a full blog post but, until then:
1. I wrote a **high-level** explanation of how keyless accounts work on the [Aptos](https://twitter.com/aptos) blockchain [here](https://aptos.dev/aptos-keyless/how-keyless-works).
2. I wrote an **in-depth** document explaining how keyless accounts work and their many caveats in [the 61th Aptos Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-61.md).
3. I did a few more things below ðŸ‘‡
