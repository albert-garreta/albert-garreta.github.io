{: .info}
**tl;dr:** What is a **keyless blockchain account**?
Put simply, _"Your blockchain account = Your Google account"_. 
In other words, this keyless approach allows you to derive a blockchain account from any of your existing OpenID Connect (OIDC) account (e.g., Google, Apple), rather than from a traditional secret key or mnemonic. 
There are no long-term secret keys you need to manage.
There is also no multi-party computation (MPC) system managing your account for you.
As a result, the risk of account loss is (more or less), the risk of losing your Google account.
Keyless is built using a [Groth16](/groth16) zero-knowledge proof to maintain privacy in both directions: prevent the blockchain from learning anything about your Google account & prevent Google from learning anything about your blockchain account and transaction activity.

One day, I hope to edit this into a full blog post but, until then, here's a bunch of resources.


## Drawings

### Flow: Keyless on-chain verification

Depicts what the blockchain validators need to do to verify a keyless TXN submitted by a user, Alice.

### ZK relation: Keyless authentication

The ZK relation needed for keyless:

### Flow: End-to-end keyless transacting 

Depicts the full keyless flow: the user generating an ESK and EPK, the user signing into the dapp with the EPK as the OIDC `nonce`, the dapp getting a JWT, exchanging it for a pepper, getting a ZKP from the prover service, the user signing a TXN with their ESK, the dapp sending the TXN containing the ZKP and ephemeral signature, and finally the blockchain verifying everything.

### Flow: End-to-end keyless ZKless-transacting (currently, disabled)

In case of emergency (e.g., a serious soundness issue in the ZK circuit), keyless supports a **ZKless** mode that is **not** privacy preserving.
This, of course, is currently **disabled** on Aptos mainnet.

We depicts this (simpler) ZKless flow: the user generating an ESK and EPK, the user signing into the dapp with the EPK as the OIDC `nonce`, the dapp getting a JWT, the user signing a TXN with their ESK, the dapp sending the TXN containing the ephemeral signature, and finally the blockchain verifying everything.

### ZK relation: Oblivious pepper service

The ZK relation needed to implement an [oblivious pepper service][oblivious-pepper]:

<div align="center"><img style="width:65%" src="/pictures/keyless-oblivious-pepper-relation.png" /></div>

### Flow: Fetching your pepper obliviously 

We depict the flow for a dapp to fetch its user's pepper _obliviously_ from the pepper service, without leaking the user's ID nor the application's ID to the service.

## Write-ups

1. I wrote a [high-level overview](https://aptos.dev/en/build/guides/aptos-keyless/how-keyless-works) of how keyless accounts work on the [Aptos](https://twitter.com/aptos) blockchain 
2. I wrote an [in-depth explanation](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/AIPs/blob/main/aips/aip-61.md) of how keyless accounts work (and their many caveats) in the 61st Aptos Improvement Proposal.

 - Code: [AnonAdhar](https://github.com/anon-aadhaar/anon-aadhaar/blob/main/packages/circuits/src/helpers/signature.circom), by PSE, does RSA2048-SHA2-256 signature verification in `circom` within ~900K R1CS constraints

{: .note}
The notation below will not be explicitly defined; just exercise intuition! 
e.g., $\maxaudval$ is clearly the maximum number of bytes in $\audval$.

### Hashing the identity commitment (IDC) in the address

\begin{align}
\addridc \bydef \poseidon^\F_4\left(
    \begin{array}{l}
        \pepper[0..30],\\\\\
        \poseidon^\mathbb{S}\_{\maxaudval}(\audval),\\\\\
        \poseidon^\mathbb{S}\_{\maxuidval}(\uidval),\\\\\
        \poseidon^\mathbb{S}\_{\maxuidkey}(\uidkey)\\\\\
    \end{array}
\right)
\end{align}

{: .todo}
Define $\poseidon^\mathbb{S}_\ell(s)$.
