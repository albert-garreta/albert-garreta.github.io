**tl;dr:** Everything I wanted to know but was afraid to ask about `circom`.

## Notes

As put by Palladino[^Pall23]:
> The main challenges [in] Circom is understanding when you are writing constraint-generation code, and when you are writing witness-generation code, and tracking what values are known at compile-time versus only known at runtime.
> [...]
> Keeping in mind the difference between constraint and witness generation times can guard you against underconstrained computation bugs.

### Terminology

 - **witness generation**: computation of _hints_ a.k.a. "witness data" that aids in satisfying the constraints encoded in a circom template
    - can be sped up with [parallel](https://docs.circom.io/circom-language/templates-and-components/#components) keyword
 - **variables**
    - [circom docs say](https://docs.circom.io/circom-language/variables-and-mutability/): _"variables are identifiers that hold non-signal data and are mutable."_
    - but, a more accurate mental model, AFAICT, is that they are compile-time symbolic expressions (e.g., often they are used to symbolically-store a linear combination of signals at compile time; see the [Num2Bits example](#num2bits-template))
 - **functions**: reusable pieces of code used only during _witness generation_
 - **signals**
    - input signals; i.e.,:
        + part of the NP relation's statement or witness
        + you cannot do `s <== expression` for `signal input s`; only for `signal s`.
    - output signals
    - intermediate signals (computed via witness generation)
 - **template**: a family of circuits, parameterized by one or more values known at compile-time (think C++ templates)
    + template parameters
 - components
    - [anonymous components](https://docs.circom.io/circom-language/anonymous-components-and-tuples/)
 - **assignment**
 - **constraints**

### `var` versus `signal`

{: .todo}
Give some examples here. [Num2Bits](#num2bits-template) is one.

### Witness generation versus constraints

{: .todo}
Find a more natural circuit that showcases this difference. Not `IsZero()`.

As explained by Palladino[^Pall23]:

 > When writing a circuit you're writing two different programs, that belong to two different programming paradigms, in a single one.

The most important thing to know: [when (not) to use `<--`](https://github.com/pluto/circom-correctly-constrained?tab=readme-ov-file#when-may-a-developer-choose-to-use----assignment-over-).

### Tags

Very useful for safety.
See nice article by Hess[^Hess24].

Tags can have compile-time values:

 > "Valued tags behave like parameters which means that they can only be assigned to values known at compilation time."

This suggests max lengths of strings could be tags.

### Buses

Very useful for readable code.
See [here](https://docs.circom.io/circom-language/buses/#definition).

Buses, combined with [tags](#tags) can start emulating a safe type system in `circom`.

For example, an elliptic curve point can be represented as:

```
bus Point() {
    signal x;
    signal y;
}
```

Then, you can have templates that work like this:

```
template Edwards2Montgomery () {
  input  Point() { edwards_point    } in;
  output Point() { montgomery_point } out;

  out.x <â€“- (1 + in.y) / (1 - in.y);
  out.y <â€“- out.x / in.x;

  out.x * (1 - in.y) === (1 + in.y);
  out.y * in.x === out.x;
}
```

### Assert

The `assert` keyword is particularly "interesting."
I think I'm gonna stay away from it.

Quoting from [here](https://github.com/pluto/circom-correctly-constrained?tab=readme-ov-file#the-basics):
```
// if all values are known at compile-time the assertion is checked then
// otherwise, the assertion creates a constraint.
assert(a <= b);
assert(a * a == b);
```

## Non-trivial examples

### `IsZero()` template

This is a template that outputs 1 when the input signal is 0 and outputs 0 otherwise.

It should be the most trivial thing to implement, no?
Yet it turns out that, while checking whether something is zero is trivial (i.e., `something === 0`), assigning a signal with the truth value of `something === 0` is not as trivial...
(This is because the only operations in `circom` are equality checks, addition and multiplication.)

{: .note}
This example will also illustrate the difference between _witness generation_ versus _constraining_.

{% highlight circom linenos %}
template IsZero() {
  signal input in;
  signal output out;
  signal inv;

  inv <-- in != 0 ? 1/in : 0;

  out <== -in * inv + 1;
  in * out === 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

How does it work? Here's a simple analysis:

 - When `in` is 0, then:
    - `out <== -in * inv + 1` (line 8) implies `out <== 0 * inv + 1`.
	+ Which implies `out <== 1`, ensuring the desired behaviour.
	- **Q**: But then `inv` does not even matter for this case? Which is why it is assigned 0? But why 0? It could be assigned anything it seems.
 - When `in` is **not** 0, then:
    - `in * out === 0` (line 9) implies `out === 0`. 
	+ As a result, `out <== -in * inv + 1` implies `0 <== -in * inv + 1`
	+ Which implies `in * inv === 1`
	- Which can be satisfied, since the witness generation can compute an inverse via the  `inv <-- in != 0 ? 1/in : 0` line.

{: .error}
**Observation:** I find the explanation in [`circom`'s docs](https://docs.circom.io/circom-language/basic-operators/#examples-using-operators-from-the-circom-library) a bit confusing, perhaps even in a dangerous way.
It says: _"If `in` is 0, then [...]. Otherwise, `in * inv` is always 1, then `out` is 0."_
This could be interpreted to suggest that `circom` enforces that `inv` be correctly computed as the inverse of `in`. Which is not the case. 
It's not that circom guarantees `in * inv` will be always 1; it's that when `in` is _not_ zero, the only way to satisfy line 8 and 9's constraints is to correctly compute the inverse `inv` via the witness generation on line 6.

{: .note}
In a way, this rather-elegant `IsZero()` template perfectly illustrates how non-intuitive `circom` can be when it comes to efficiently-programming ZK relations.

### `Num2Bits()` template

Let's also consider the `Num2Bits()` [example from circom's docs](https://docs.circom.io/circom-language/basic-operators/#examples-using-operators-from-the-circom-library), which returns the binary representation of its input, as `n` bits (although edited with more sane variable names and annotated with comments).

This example illustrates:
 - template parameters (e.g., `n`)
 - _variables_ versus _signals_
 - _witness generation_ versus _constraining_

{% highlight circom linenos %}
template Num2Bits(n) {
    signal input in;
    signal output out[n];

    // will be incrementally updated to eventually store the symbolic expression:
    // out[0] * 1 + out[1] * 2 + out[2] * 2^2 + ... + out[n-1] * (2^(n-1))
    var acc = 0;
    var pow2 = 1;     // stores increasing powers of two: 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ...

    for (var i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        out[i] <-- (in >> i) & 1;   // extracts in's ith bit
        out[i] * (out[i] - 1) === 0; // constrains out[i] to be a bit

        // appends a "+ out[i] * 2^i" term to the symbolic expression in acc
        acc += out[i] * pow2;   

        // sets this to 2^{i+1}
        pow2 = pow2 + pow2;
    }
    
    // since acc stores the symbolic expression from above, this constraint
    // ensures that the bits in out[i] are indeed the binary representation of in 
    acc === in;

}
{% endhighlight %}

{: .note}
It was actually ChatGPT who helped me understand that `acc` merely stores a symbolic expression that is derivable at compile-time (see [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/67d70727-0e14-8001-9831-a003bb53aa57)), because the circom docs, as far as I could tell, do not do a good job at clarifying the distinction between circom signals and circom variables.
So: _"thx chat!"_

## Conclusion

`circom` is an amazing tools for implementing ZK relations that (obviously) makes the developer's job 10,000x easier than writing R1CS constraints directly.

I am still trying to understand the many pitfalls developers can fall into when writing `circom` code, most importantly, under-constraining bugs.

Looking forward to looking at [NoirLang](https://x.com/NoirLang) to see if it makes it easier to distinguish between constraints and witness generation?
